# Rainmeter-MediaMonkey
A rainmeter plugin for [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com). The plugin was designed with compatibility with the [official NowPlaying plugin](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/plugins/nowplaying/) in mind, so most configurations for NowPlaying should be usable with minimal configuration changes.

## Usage
Copy MediaMonkey.dll to your \Rainmeter\Plugins directory and create a measure with settings Plugin=MediaMonkey.

## Parameters
### Settings
- __PlayerName__ - Reference to the parent of a child measure. Not required for parent measures.
- __PlayerPath__ - Path to MediaMonkey.exe. If not provided, the plugin will attempt to auto-locate MediaMonkey.
- __PlayerType__ - Type of the measure that should be returned. See below for valid measures.
- __DisableLeadingZero__ - Removes the leading zero for the measures Duration and Position (i.e. MM:SS becomes M:SS). The default value is 0.
- __StartupDelay__ - Delay in millisecond to wait until sending queries to MediaMonkey after it was started. Increase if MediaMonkey crashes right after starting while Rainmeter is running. The default value is 900.
